This project is a Chip-8 interpreter compiled for Linux. It is based on the tutorial from [Multigesture](http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/).

To compile:

make
```
To run the interpreter, call it from command line and give as the first argument a path to a game. See folder "games".
